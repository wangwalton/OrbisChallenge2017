<h2>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Luminis is a two-player territory expansion strategy game where you command a team of fireflies to compete for territory against your opponent on a tile-based board. You and your opponent each begin with a single nest from which new fireflies are spawned at each turn. Every square on the board, except for walls, is a luminescent tile that illuminates the colour of its most recent visitor.</p>
<p>You can build a nest by colouring the adjacent tiles of a neutral tile (i.e. a tile that has never been visited yet). You need to protect a nest’s adjacent tiles to keep it alive. If your opponent acquires even just one of its adjacent tiles, your nest is destroyed, and it and its adjacent tiles become your opponent’s permanent territory. Unlike normal tiles, permanent territory will not change owners regardless of its most recent visitor, so you can never reclaim it.</p>
<p>If you have a group of nests with overlapping adjacent tiles, this is called a cluster. If just one nest in the cluster is destroyed, the entire cluster is also destroyed and becomes your opponent’s permanent territory.</p>
<p>The game ends if you eliminate all your opponent’s nests, or if your opponent eliminates all your nests (or at timeout). You earn 1 point per tile you own at the end of the game - plus another point per permanent tile. You win if your score is higher than that of your opponent.</p>

<p>For every turn, there’s only one command that a firefly will need: “move into this tile beside you, or stay still”. Pretty simple, right? All your AI needs to do is assign a movement for each of your fireflies per turn :)</p>
<div class="admonition note">

<p>A firefly can move <strong>one tile distance per turn in any one of four cardinal directions</strong>: north, east, south or west. It may also rest for that turn.</p>
<p>Fireflies can visit tiles but not walls or nests.</p>
<p>Fireflies cause tiles to illuminate their team’s colour by moving into them. However, if your opponent moves into one of your tiles after you’ve left it, your opponent becomes the new owner of that tile (of course, until you send another one of your fireflies to reclaim it).</p>

<p>The game implements conflict resolution using topological sort, which is <strong>optional</strong> knowledge and beyond the scope of this section. (However, if you are interested, there’s a brief description in the FAQ.)</p>
<p>We suggest that you don’t worry about it too much, but here’s the short summary:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>If, in a given turn, there’s a chain of fireflies that are all trying to move down the chain, all fireflies will successfully move into their targets without merging into friendly fireflies or being blocked by an enemy. That is, move requests are executed in reverse order, starting with the firefly at the bottom of the chain. Damage, however, is always calculated.</li>
<li>If there are two adjacent friendly fireflies trying to swap positions, they will do so successfully without merging.</li>

<p>Nests are an important part of the game. By building nests, you spawn more firefly fireflies to cover more ground more quickly. By destroying enemy nests, you reduce your opponent’s firefly population and earn permanent territory. The game ends when you or your opponent lose all your nests.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
