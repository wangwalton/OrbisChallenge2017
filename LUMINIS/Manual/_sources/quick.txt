Quick Start Guide
=================

.. admonition:: TL;DR
   :class: tldr
   
   Install JDK (1.8 or newer) and the challenge starter pack. Run the Launcher.

First, make sure you have Java 1.8+ (and optionally Python 3.5+ if you plan on making a Python AI) 
installed and added to your PATH. Check out our handy page on getting all that sorted :doc:`here <installing>`.

Setting up the starter packs
----------------------------

1. In your competitor dashboard from the Orbis Challenge website, download the starter pack of your choice from Dropbox by clicking on the "Download starter kit" button.
2. Unzip the starter pack in any working directory.
3. Ensure that you have full permissions for all the content in the starter pack folder.

	* In a Linux environment, you can do this by executing the shell command::

		sudo chmod -R 755 "PATH_TO_STARTER_PACK_FOLDER"

	* In Windows, you can confirm that you have full control by right-clicking on the starter pack folder and navigating to Properties -> Security.



Running the game with a sample AI
---------------------------------

Just so you can see the game in action right away, the starter packs include a very simple sample AI for you to run the game with. Here are the steps for you to follow:

1. Go into the "LUMINIS" folder in your starter pack.
2. Run Launcher.sh (Linux) or Launcher.bat (Windows) on the console to start the launcher.
3. The launcher should default to the sample AI configurations. Click the Start button to run the game.

.. HINT::
  For more information about any setting in the launcher, just hover your mouse over it to pop up the tool-tip.

Once you are able to run the game with the default AI player, you can try running the game with your own AI.
The sample AI is located inside the LUMINIS/Bots folder of the starter pack. You can keep your AI in any subdirectory of the Bots folder.
