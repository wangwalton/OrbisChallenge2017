Scoring and the Tournament
==========================

Here is where you can find information on how to do well in the Challenge. 

	
Grading Scheme
--------------

Scores are calculated at the end of the game. 

The game ends when one team loses all their nests or at time-out.

At the end of the game, each team earns 1 point per tile owned. Plus, each team earns another 1 point per tile in their permanent territories. So it's possible for you to eliminate your opponent's nests and still lose the game!


Submissions
-----------

Follow the following steps when you are ready to submit your submission. 

1. Make sure all your source code and external libraries are zipped up. **The zip file containing your files should be named exactly after your team name.**

.. Warning::
	To ensure your AI works correctly, make sure you test it in a game before submitting!

.. Note::
	* We only accept .zip files that are under 5 MB in size. 
	* The libraries that came in the development kits will be replaced when grading, so feel free to exclude them when creating your archive.
	* Include any custom libraries that you use

2. Upload your newly created archives on 'Submit your AI' on your dashboard on The Challenge website. If you are working in a team, only one member has to upload it.

.. Note::	
	You're welcome to submit more than once, but only your latest submission before the submission deadline will be graded, so make sure that one works!

Competition Format
--------------------

The tournament is split into two parts. 

    1. The qualifiers
    	Scores are summed over all matches in the qualifers, and the top 20 scores will advance to the round robins.
    2. The round robins
    	Each entry will fight every other entry to the end! The top 5 winners are selected in this round.

The top 20 AIs from the round robin will be chosen for code review.
The top 5 winners will be determined based on both their performance in the competition, and their code review.
Winners will need to give a short presentation.

Settings
````````

All games will be played using the following settings: 

	* Board is symmetrical, and its size is set at 19x19.
	* Maximum amount of time allowed for your AI to make a move is 600 milliseconds
	
Qualifying Round
`````````````````
In this round your submission will play on various maps against 3 qualifier bots of various difficulties. The top 20 entries with the highest summed scores over the 3 matches will advance to the next round. (Time limit: 100 turns)

Round Robin Finals
```````````````````
Suppose your submission made it to the top 20. Congratulations! There are 19 other players here with you, so it's time to battle it out. You'll be playing a match against each opponent on multiple maps, it's time to show them who's the boss! (Turn limit: 200 turns)

Algorithm and Code Review
`````````````````````````
This is the part where we evaluate your code! Your AI has proven that it can perform, but how well-coded is it? Be sure to make your code as readable as possible and leave some comments for the code reviewers to read!

Presentations
`````````````
The teams that have their submissions land in the top 5 after the playoffs and code review are asked to give a short presentation to talk about their key strategies, the problems they faced and how they overcame them.
